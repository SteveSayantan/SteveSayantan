## Basics of Communication

1. Spark up a conversation within first 7 seconds, with smile
   - Keep body language open
   - Being well groomed helps too


1. Don't ask standard questions (e.g. How are you doing?)
   - Focus on things happening right now
   - Focus on 'this' time period (e.g. How are you doing today?)
   - If possible, go one level deep toward sharing opinions and feelings.


1. When meeting someone for the first time, try to draw similarity between you and the other person.
   - Try to overlook contradiction and find similarities instead.


1. Give complements (Be original)
   - Be specific, don't say common stuff.
   - Try to notice interesting facts about the other person.
   - For any negative trait, look for some positivity in that.


1. Ask for help/opinion
   - It makes the other person feel better.
   - This can be used both as a starter/ in the middle of a conversation.

     For Example:
     - What are your thoughts on...
     - Could you help me out with ...
     - You are so good in ... / Can you help me in ...


 1. Use humor
    - Don't be too serious.
    - Add on to someone's joke.
    - Make fun of yourself.


 1. Starting a conversation with someone while in a group is relatively easy.


 1. Exit the conversation with a positive sign, make sure you are the person to leave.


 1. Be mindful in a conversation.


 1. Remember key points such as name, children, their hobby, current activities etc. of the other person.
